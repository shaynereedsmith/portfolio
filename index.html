      <p>Game developer, UX/UI designer, front-end coder.
      <br>
      My main interest and reason for being involved with technology has to do with its storytelling potential. Technology has grown so quickly and access to digital content has opened up so widely that developers worldwide are struggling to keep up with a constantly maturing and diversified user base.
      <br>I want the users of my applications to have an authentic and captivating experience that demonstrates the respect I have for their evolving sensibilities while also showcasing the innovative spirit that exists in technology.
      <br>I am an experienced illustrator and game designer and developer. Currently a student at CodeFellows studying HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</p>
